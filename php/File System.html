    <h1>Working with File System in PHP</h1>

    <h2>File Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        File permissions in PHP are essential for controlling who can access and
        manipulate files. Permissions include read, write, and execute permissions
        for the owner, group, and others.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
// Example: Setting file permissions
chmod("file.txt", 0644);</pre>
    </div>

    <h2>File Operations</h2>
    <p>
        PHP provides various functions for working with files, including opening,
        reading, writing, copying, renaming, deleting, and closing files.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <span>Opening and Reading a File : </span>

            To open and read a file in PHP, you can use the
            <span>fopen()</span> function to open the file and
            <span>fread()</span> function to read its contents. Here's an example:
            <div class="code">
                <pre>
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$content = fread($file, filesize("example.txt"));
echo $content;
fclose($file);</pre>
                </div>
                <p>Output :</p>
               Working with the file system is an essetial part of many PHP applications<br><br>
        <li>
            <span>Writing to a File : </span>

            To write data to a file in PHP, you can use the
            <span>fopen()</span> function with the "w" mode to open the file for
            writing and the <span>fwrite()</span> function to write data. Here's an
            example:
            <div class="code">
                <pre>
$file = fopen("output.txt", "w");
fwrite($file, "Hello, PHP!");
fclose($file);</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Output :</p>
File 'output.txt' has been written successfully.<br>            
            <br>
            <div class="output">
                <img src="../examples/php/fileWrittenData.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>Copying Files : </span>

            You can copy files in PHP using the <span>copy()</span> function. It
            takes the source file path and the destination file path as arguments.
            Here's an example:
            <div class="code">
                <pre>copy("source.txt", "destination.txt");</pre>
            </div>
            
            <div class="output">
                <img src="../examples/php/fileCopy.png" alt="">
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>Renaming Files : </span>
            To rename a file in PHP, you can use the <span>rename()</span> function.
            It takes the current file name and the new file name as arguments.
            Here's an example:
            <div class="code">
                <pre>rename("old_file.txt", "new_file.txt");</pre>
            </div>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>Deleting a File : </span>

            To delete a file in PHP, you can use the <span>unlink()</span> function.
            It takes the file path as an argument. Here's an example:
            <div class="code">
                <pre>
if(unlink("file_to_delete.txt")){
    echo "File deleted successfully";
}</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Output :</p>
File deleted successfully<br>            
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>File System Functions</h2>
    <p>
        PHP offers a range of file system functions to interact with files and
        directories, including <span>file_exists()</span>, <span>is_file()</span>,
        <span>is_dir()</span>, and more.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
// Example: Checking if a file exists
if (file_exists("file.txt")) {
    echo "File exists.";
}</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Output :</p>
  File exists.<br>
    <h2>Working with Directories</h2>
    <p>
        PHP allows you to work with directories, create new directories, list
        directory contents, and navigate through the file system.
    </p>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>
// Example: Creating a directory
mkdir("new_directory");

// Example: Listing directory contents
$files = scandir("directory_path");
foreach ($files as $file) {
    echo $file . "&lt;br&gt;";
}</pre>
    </div>
    <p>Output :</p>
Directory created successfully<br>   
    <p>files in the directory :</p>
data.json<br>
index.css<br>
index.html<br>
index.js<br>
index.css<br>
index.ts<br>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Working with the file system is an essential part of many PHP
        applications. Understanding file permissions, file operations, file system
        functions, and directory manipulation is crucial for building robust and
        functional file-based applications.
